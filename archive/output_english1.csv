0. Which§0. Which year did you start as CEO? (Let the CEO select if several applicable CEO jobs).§1999: The reason why I work with PE is that working them is very objective and there are not sentiments. It is fact based and objective and transparent and you know exactly what the goal is. There is no room for politics. There is one goal is to create a value increase.§§October 2020. (Total three years)§I was with co-founder with Biovian in 2003, and became in CEO in 2012, but we got the PE involved in 2018.§"2005 
Two times."§2017 - 2021§2020: Been with 2 PE owners.§2009 (Impilo came in in 2019)§1994-21 (27 years)§2009. Worked in 2 PE owned companies in total§Late 2012. (first and only time)§
1. Please§1. Please describe the 2 most important actions performed by the owner representatives that contributed to successful trust & alignment between the owner representatives and you as CEO (alignment regarding critical objectives, business plan and way of working together)?§1: PE fund asked me what chairman of the board I would prefer which increased my confidence in them. 2: I was involved in all discussions; company performance, remuneration, selection of board members, performance evaluation of board members; everything was tremendously transparent.§1: Choice of chairman of the board 2: Unconditional support i.e. You know that you have the trust of the owner regarding your judgment, ability to assess the situation, and that they will not meddle in things.§1: Very strong on financial reporting 2: Very clear about what we want to do and accomplish. 3: Provide us with the required knowledge from their networks to support our goals.§1: Freedom and flexibility to do what we want. 2: Alignment regarding the annual growth targets and the growth targets 5-7 years. For example, if you invest in CAPEX and human resources you may see a momentary drop in profitability however this is with the understanding that you will be able to reach your exit goal.§1: Planning and honest communication about expectations.§1: Nominated two strong candidates to the board. 2: Cross-functional activities with the other portfolio companies§1: Openness on their part. 2: Structure in terms leadership on their side;  they did not bypass the CEO or play the owner card.§1: They had a formula for onboarding companies; a two-page term sheet that outlined intentions, ownership structure etc. 2: Did an extensive due-diligence on the company.§1: I was also the major shareholder so I had a lot of control 2: Agreement on the strategy and the actions.§1: We jointly started working on a plan; they had some considerations about how to develop the company but they involved us and allowed us to give maximal input which generated confidence. 2: Put someone onto the board that had understanding of the industry. If it was only PE people, it would be too much figures and too little industry know-how.§1: Choosing a CEO that they knew could work with well with 2: They knew very much what they got and what they’re looking for. 3: I met with the deal team as much as once per week; we were about 5 minutes from each other. These interactions between the board meetings were extremely important, it was made that we came close.§1: We bought the company together and did the DD together; this in of itself was a trust-building exercise. 2: It was a carve-out; to put me in place as a non-proven CEO and giving me freedom and mandates created a lot of trust between us. 3: I had control of the numbers; good EBITDA levels. This created a lot of trust 4: I was also invested in the company; PE knew how much skin the game I had. 5: They did exactly what they said they would do. 6: They got really involved even joining our Christmas parties; this type of engagement showed that they really cared.
2. Please§2. Please provide 2 specific suggestions for how the owner representatives could have acted to even further strengthen trust & alignment between the owner representatives and you as CEO?§It was perfect; could not have been done better.§No.§He mentioned that PE is very result focused and their performance evaluation is KPI driven. I ask if this is something that is negative, and he says “no, after all my job is to create shareholder value and KPI’s point me in that direction. That is part of the gaming of working with PE.”§1: More active participation during the board meetings, not just sitting there.§1: More communication during this phase so it is not only once per month.§1: I was very positive about possible PE ownership because I wanted a strong strategic active involved owner. Nordic Capital were most bold in terms of price and offer which was great. However, I would have liked to have sat down with them initially and have them explain their rationale and expectations for the company. I asked them that but they had no answer. They were very passive.§1: A little closer contact in the beginning.§1: PE lacked entrepreneurial spirit sprit; Lack of alignment regarding this became apparent quite quickly. PE wanted reporting, forecasting and constant reviewing which was a real-time constraint for our management team. However, we wanted to get on with it. I spent 20% of my time delivering or preparing reports for the PE firm. It gave them comfort but prevented us from doing things that we needed to do. 2: They were expecting us to do all of the work regarding finance and control; but we expected them to do more of the job since they are the ones with the competence.§1: Board composition with industrial expertise 2: Increase industrial knowledge§1: When selecting industrial people to the board they did a fair job, but not a good job. The one’s that we got into the board did not contribute enough to the development of the company; selection could have been more thorough. 2: More involvement of the management in the plan§Extremely happy§Nothing!
3. Imagine§3. Imagine that you responded to the following question 6 months into your CEO assignment – how do you score the degree of trust & alignment between the owner representatives and you as CEO regarding critical objectives, business plan and way of working together – on a 10 grade scale where “3” is poor, “5” is ok and “7” is good?§10§100%§8.§9§8.§4.§10.§9-10.

6. Please§6. Please describe the 2 most important contributions by the owner representatives on the theme of  business-critical knowledge & competence (in the shape of competencies, methods, people etc.)?§1: Expertise in corporate finance 2: Selected industry experts on the board.  3: Functional expertise via the PE firm’s extensive network.§1: If you really want to have your fingers in the soup then you need to be really good in the substance. The CEO hates nothing more than an owner that spends 45 minutes reading a report and then are an expert on the topic. PE can be bring competence in the field of governance,  finance, M&A as well as choice of CEO and board composition.§1: The invest the needed resources in their board. The strongest boards I have worked with have always been under PE. 2: They are open to investing and providing the resources to accomplish our goals. 3: They have a broad network off people e.g., a consultant in operations.§1: Industry driven expertise and understanding of the inherent dynamics of the industry. PE funds that focus a bit on everything are not as attractive as they cannot support the company as much.§1: Outstanding at generating value. 2: Have great experience with mergers and acquisitions.§1: They appointed industrial, external and independent board members which improved our governance. 2: They were very keen in understanding how we run our operations.§1: Financial competence, access to financial sources, knowledge about structuring the financing 2: They surprisingly good market knowledge.§1: Financial analysis 2: Industry intelligence 3: Management consulting capabilities 4: A lot of experience running mature companies.§1: They provided great help with financing 2: They had very open discussions with the management team, did not mandate too much.§1: Financing issues; this is where they come from. 2: Made us take a wider strategic view. If you work in a business for many years your view of the business might get too narrow and they helped with this. They told us to “please look ahead.”§1: Hiring of industrial advisors 2: Beautiful part of being under PE; they have all the formal knowledge you would gain from university. They have developed intricate models which allowed you to make predictions for any calculations.  3: They link you up with seasoned advisors from the industry.§1: Knowledge regarding how you build large companies by combining smaller companies 2: How to build a company that is more than the sum of its parts; synergies 3: How to work with banks e.g., debt financing 4: Negotiations in terms of M&A.
7. Please§7. Please provide 2 specific suggestions for how the owner representatives could have made even stronger contributions on the theme of business-critical knowledge & competence?§1: In one or two cases I asked for functional assistance they were reluctant because they felt that they did not understand the need.§1: It is important to understand the basic dynamics of the company 2: Understand the ability of the business to leverage. PE has a favor for leverage, and sometimes do not account for the fact that some businesses are already very leveraged.§1: Sometimes they miss a lot in-depth industry and brand understanding and thus we miss discussions on the underlying factors that drive the business.§1: More focus on facilitating contact with network and opinion leaders in our industry.§1: Using external advisors and third-party expertise to fill the gap in industrial knowledge which PE has.§Nothing to add.§Perfect§1:They knew what the end goal was but they did not a good job getting us there. They expected things to go much faster and did not possess capability. Impilo were mostly focused on covering their back-sides i.e., changing CEO and bringing in Mckinsey. It is really unfortunate since the company has turned around since then. 2: They spent tremendous amount of money on Mckinsey report; that money could have been spent on putting a controller in place which would have freed up management from reporting time 3: Expected them to be really good at raising capital but they weren’t. Lacked experience in bringing in capital into early-stage companies. When a PE company is already sitting on your board and owning ¼ of the company, it is really hard to get additional investors because they see it as a poisoned well. They should have focused on investing more, instead of looking of external capital and trying to get out.§1: More proactive with linking us with their network of industrial experts and knowledge from other portfolio companies.§1: Selecting board members with industrial expertise§I got everything I asked for.§1: The level of diversity in our fund is relatively low; most of them consist of ex investment bankers. It would be interesting to have a slightly more diverse set of capabilities with venture capital background or a biotech background. Of course, you can always find that through external experience.

11. Please§11. Please describe the 2 most important contributions by the owner representatives to ensure an effective governance model, i.e. for performance management of the company and its business plan?§1: Selection of a tremendously competent chairman of the board 2: web-based tools for reporting: it was easy, intuitive and structured.§1: A chairman of the board that is well-versed in governance.§1: Governance is PE’s core competence. They ensure that there is a clear strategy in place and link the strategy to clear actions and targets. They have outperformed all of their owners we have had in this regard, whether family, listed or privately owned.§1: A chairman of the board with governance expertise; crucial as it results in a clear division of what the role of the CEO and the chairman of the board is and fluid running of the board.§1: GLOC model where each quarter we had had different themes: budgeting, strategy, acquisitions and human resources. 2: Yearly and quarterly planning.§1: Strengthening the risk committee. 2: Improving the quality of the board materials and the work in the committees.§1: They did not do anything specific besides have a formal board and rules & regulations which I consider normal.§1: Setting up a structured board; but that was about it.§1: Structured financial reporting 2§1: Requirement of a thorough business-plan. 2: Strong follow up instruments 3: Comprehensive reporting system that gave a wider overview of the business.§1: All of the competencies that you needed were available to you on a daily basis. 2: Ensured that people on the board would be people with good names in the industrial world as well as the financial world. 3: Triton’s slogan is to build better business; this strategy covered every single aspect of a business including building a well-functioning governance model.§1: They let me handled this; I set the governance myself!
12. Please§12. Please provide 2 specific suggestions for how the owner representatives could have made even stronger contributions to ensure an effective governance model?§1: Too many board meetings in critical meetings which took time away from running the company; reducing number of boarding meetings would have helped significantly.§1: Owner should not directly be imposing governance; it should come from the chairman of the board and the board.§1: Have stronger interest and intel on our industry. They are generalists and miss out sometimes on important details that are unique to our industry.§1: PE needs to be active in finding board members with industrial expertise. In a small company there can be very limited expertise on the board. For example, family members may even be on the board. However, when a company grows to a certain size, board members need to be professional and have sufficient expertise.§1: PE should be more open with documentation and information. PE like to keep the freedom about what to do and therefore they do not like to put all things on paper to maintain their power.§1: The whole board could have been a stronger alignment and build trust. We should have spent more time on alignment about our goals and encouraging people rather than being critical. Trust is important in order to make changes.§1: Clearer on were they epact to be involved in decisions and where I could make decisions; it was fluffy in the beginning.§1: Older chairman that had a lot of experience in the sector but his energy level was low and he was very rigid in his role even when though we needed to move fast. 2: Board served had police functioning which is destructive for a management team; we were used to a collaborative board that enhanced us. This board just wanted us to explain why we had not reached the numbers 3: They took me off the board; they had me in for the presentations but then asked me to leave. Up until their arrival, I had been running the board, so it became very awkward for me.§1: PE owners need to adapt their governance model depending on the company; sometimes they try to use a one-fit all model. 2: They need a specific person focused on helping the company adjust to their governance policy; difficult to do it alone.§They did well on that.§Perfect§Nothing

14. If§14. If score <7, Which 2 key factors explain the score?§§§§§§§§We felt like we were abandoned. They assumed we were a mature company where they could relax and have us do all of the work. However, we were in an entrepreneurial stage where things where changing all of the time and we needed that support.§§§§
15. Which§15. Which 3 key factors or actions would have improved the score to 9?§§§§§§§1: Sat down with the owner to set up a clear mandate and responsibilities.§1: Roll up their sleeves and join the management team in working on the 90-day plan. 2: Serve a collaborative and parentship role.§§§§
16. In§16. In your first business plan as CEO of the private equity owned company – what is your view of the overall ambition level regarding financial & strategic targets?§(iii) Targets at the right level§(iii) Targets at the right level§(iii) Targets at the right level§(iii) Targets at the right level§(iii) Targets at the right level§(iii) Targets at the right level§(v) Targets were clearly over-ambitious§(ii) Somewhat too low targets§(iv) Targets were somewhat over-ambitious§(iii) Targets at the right level§(iv) Targets were somewhat over-ambitious§(v) Targets were clearly over-ambitious
17a. Please§17a. Please provide short motivation to your answer in question 16?§I was involved in setting those targets; definitely felt that they were realistic.§We have a hands-off PE and thus the management team were given the freedom to set the business plan’s ambition level.§1: This case was realistic. In my previous case it was a tough one. In the first  case we sold a rapid growth company to PE and they expected 40% growth without any plateau which was unrealistic.§They were quite realistic; On the tough side but still doable.§On the upper-side of the right level. Not too low and neither too high. We achieved quite well.§They were passive. We did it ourselves.§We were struggling with them because we did not have the financing required to execute on them. We had to continuously explain to the banks why we were behind and the board meetings were difficult as they expected much higher results.§Impilo was conservative; they would always ratchet down our goals. This was surprising since the fundamentals were the strong. Impilo came in and gave us a hair-cut. I question why they were interested to begin with even if they did not have higher aspirations. They were probably writing the exit strategy quite early on, and they wanted to downplay the opportunity so they could justify to their limited partners why the needed to get out.§They were a bit too ambitious even though we were able to meet them. Instead of stretching targets it is better to discuss what is practical.§PE were strong at identifying areas where the company needed to and could improve; they had a delicate balance between ambitious and being over-ambitious.§It’s great with stretch targets; pushes the organization. Triton was very happy with the way IPO ended up and their MOIC/IRR on the investment.§Extremely ambitious given the knowledge we had however we over achieved them massively.
17b. Roughly,§17b. Roughly, what was the target for EBIT increase for the first 3 years in the business plan?§(v) EBIT should more than double first 3 years (300%)§I entered towards the end of the holding period. I had more of a get your shit together type of mandate.§(ii) EBIT + 50 % first 3 years§(i) EBIT + 25 % first 3 years (35% to 40%)§(iv) Double EBIT first 3 years§"(v) Other 3-year EBIT target – describe briefly
2 billion SEK and the year before it was 1.7,"§I cannot recall that. This is basically the start up so it was tremendously high.§(v) EBIT should more than double first 3 years§(i) EBIT + 25 % first 3 years (10% annually)§(iv) Double EBIT first 3 years§(v) Other 3-year EBIT target – describe briefly (3x)§Quadruple EBITDA in 7 years. (We five folded it in three years)
18. Please§18. Please describe the 2 most important success factors regarding the process of developing the financial & strategic ambition level of the business plan?§1: PE firm was clearly taking the time to be involved; full dedication and time-allocation. 2: Addition of relevant resource experts that could assist in the process itself; e.g., management consultant and other analysts.§1: Understand the ability of the business and its true potential. 2: Understand the way in which the business best contributes equity value; become an expert in the qquity maximization formula for the business.§1: Very data driven. We looked at the market, competitors and the space we are in. This is a very analytical phase.§1: Comes down to really knowing the business; making viable and credible analyses of the sectors and subsectors which the company operates in.§1: Strong focus on the two most important goals: Increasing the cashflow for growth and acquisitions. PE did not want to put in cash that was not necessary.§1: Traditional process. The management did their best effort by analyzing the internal and external environment. This was followed by discussion in the board to get an objective standpoint and have them question them our assumptions§1: Detailed operational targets§1: Understanding of market dynamics and internal capabilities; impilo understood that we had strong fundamentals relative to the market.§1: Dedicated partner from the PE fund that interacted with the entire management team, not only me.§1: Clear goals; grow and gain significant market share as well focus on internationalization.§1: PE’s understanding that this is not a rehearsal of a model from a spreadsheet; they understood the holistic complexity i.e., a big business with employees. This allowed us to set realistic targets.§1: Looked at historical trends; where are the upsides and where at the downsides.
19. Please§19. Please provide 2 specific suggestions for how the development of the ambition level could have been improved further?§1: There was an area that we did not dig into analytically; would have been good to have allocated an industrial expert for this specific area.§Nothing.§Nothing to add.§1: More intense discussion regarding where the company should place its bets.§1: Setting targets at the annual level. Previously we set targets only on the three- and five-year horizon. Doing so can create a common path with specific milestones to achieve our long-term goals. This is far more clear compared to  saying lets double in size within 5 years.§1: Super disappointed that we had a PE owner that was passive and sitting on the stands. They were not keen on developing the bank. Instead they just wanted to know our company in order to know if they should purchase Nordax.§1: We were too slow in the process§1: Impilo needed to think bigger; they were quite conservative. They read the McKinsey report and only picked up on the negative bits where I read the same report and viewed it positively.§1: We had a PE partner that was entirely focused on financing; needs to be more focused on the development of the company.§The ambition was right, ambitious but realistic.§Top-notch!§Nothing to add.
20. In§20. In your first business plan as CEO of the private equity owned company – what is your view on the number of key initiatives defined in the business plan?§(ii) Well balanced number of key initiatives (adequate in every sense)§(ii) Well balanced number of  key initiatives§(iv) Too many key initiatives§(ii) Well balanced number of  key initiatives§(ii) Well balanced number of  key initiatives§(ii) Well balanced number of  key initiatives§(iv) Too many key initiatives§(ii) Well balanced number of key initiatives§(iii) Somewhat too many key initiatives§(iv) Too many key initiatives§(iv) Too many key initiatives§(iii) Somewhat too many key initiatives
21. Why§21. Why did you end up with too few or too many key initiatives (depending on answer in q20)§§§Management’s fault. We had a complex task of optimizing the backend while also delivering growth. Ideally you should not have more than 5 initiatives if you want to keep momentum§§§§It was overambitious simply. That is one of the new learnings that we have brought with the new equity fund; that we do not need so many initiatives as a small organization.§§High ambition§PE wanted to work on too many issues§Over-ambition simply but that is understandable.§Most PE funds will come in and have a very narrow scope of what they do. However, we do not act that way. We work broadly and over time we see that somethings work and somethings do not work.
22. What§22. What were the implications of too few or too many key initiatives (depending on answer in q20)§§§Harder to keep focus and delivering on everything.§§§§1: You do not do any of them good enough.2: Furthermore, the organization becomes confused because they do not know where to focus.§§There is no clear vision regarding why we have to do this project which made it seem pointless.§Unable to dedicate enough resources to each key-initiatives. Each organization has a threshold of capacity; going over it leads to underperformance.§Did not harm performance but you spend time on initiatives that initially were not value-creating enough.§
23. How§23. How many “mission-critical” initiatives (or key themes / focus areas) were part of your first business plan?§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives (3-4)§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives (3,4)§(v) 10 - 15 mission critical initiatives (10)§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives (4-5)§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives (4-5)§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives (4-5)§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives (3,4)§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives§No idea§(iv) 8-10 mission critical initiatives§(v) 10 - 15 mission critical initiatives (10)§(ii) 3-5 mission critical initiatives (3 big buckets each containing 6 initiatives)
24. Which§24. Which were the 2 most important success factors to ensure a clear priority of the “mission-critical” initiatives in the business plan?§1: Make sure that you spend the time required to do the work; don’t be lazy. 2: Collaboration between PE firm, chairman of the board, and me.§1: Understand what drives equity value. 2: Understand hygiene factors that do not necessarily generate equity value but if they are ignored may destroy equity value.§1: Clear prioritization of frontend and backend goals 2: Clear ownership and timeline for each initiative.§1: Market due diligence to understand which areas will be sustained in the next three years.§Give enough resources and time for each initiative.§1: Focusing on the initiatives that led to most growth.§1: Insight into hard data (numbers) and soft data (from staff) regarding what are the value-creating initiatives 2: Board-level discussions.§Nothing§1: Transparent communication with the PE owner in order to achieve a balance between operational and financial targets. 2: Clearly define the product portfolio. 3: Many companies claim that you need a five-year plan, but flexibility is the most important to achieve targets and react quickly to opportunity.§1: Focusing on initiatives that helped the company gain market share as this was our main ambition.  2: Focus on improving earnings.§1: Willingness to make hard decisions including closing down units that were bleeding.§1: Focus on the core-business and core-business customers; make sure that you defend it 2: Initiatives that replicate business in other markets 3: Initiatives that focus on mergers and acquisitions. 4: Consider adjacencies; don’t think too narrowly but look at initiatives beyond business as usual.
25. Please§25. Please provide 2 specific suggestions for how the process of achieving a clear priority of the key initiatives could have been even better?§1: Lack of industrial specialists that could have helped us out.§Nothing.§1: I would lower the number of the strategic must win battles. 2:  I would improve the follow up on the initiatives to secure dedication and accountability throughout the organization.§That went quite well.§Increasing pre-discussion and pre-planning for the prioritization process. It is important to have discussions about the different scenarios of each initiative before prioritizing them.§"1: Would have pushed for international expansion faster as this would have given us extra growth. 
I would pushed the international expansion faster because tht would have given us extra growth, 
I would st the rest of the board and dsicuss more strategic initaitives and acquisitons so that we could becom a bigger bank so that we could not be acquired. If I understood that this was nto about a merger so that our shalehoders can access value, I would have made a more proactive acquisition strategy."§1: The process was ok but it took too long to get started. 2: Be willing to ditch the initiatives that you do not think will work so not to waste your time. 3: Implement a running evaluation, every 14 days, in order to check if a valuation is worthwhile; use in an especially rapid changing environment.§1: Brought in a segment expert on regulatory timing and submission; essentially brought in expertise to ensure that we focused on the right areas.§1: Key is to involve all of the different groups including the PE partners, management team, and the different groups (quality manager, production director, energy director etc.) within the organization that have specific domain knowledge. 2: Understand that priorities can change; have to be flexible for the market§Perfect§1: Much more quickly reorganizing the initiatives based on performance§Nothing to add
26. How§26. How what you rate your first business plan on a 10 grade scale with regards to ambition level and clear prioritization of key initiatives? where “3” is poor, “5” is ok and “7” is good§9§9§§9§§6-7§5:§8§8-9.§9§8§10
27. If§27. If score <7, Which 2 key factors explain the score?§§§§§§Passive board.§Simply too long, too complex, and too ambitious. It was made to sell instead of meant to be executed on.§Lacked understanding of market as they should have.§§§§
28. Which§28. Which 3 key factors or actions would have improved the score to a strong 8 or 9?§§§§§§The same.§1: A little more realism; let people know that this case was made to show people and the banks that this was an interesting case for them. 2: Letting bank know that we needed more time to execute on the plan. 3: Do not make business plan too complex.§1: Brought in market expertise; we had that on the management but also in the board would have been helpful. 2: Burn-rate was too high; taking quick action on that front could have reduced the burn and made everyone much calmer versus being in panic mode.§§§§
29. In§29. In which ways did you secure strong organizational ownership for the business plan´s objectives and key initiatives – describe the 2 most important actions?§1: Make sure that you involve people in the development of the business plan; don’t ever to try to do things everything yourself. Your job as CEO is to orchestrate, not play an instrument.  2: Keep informing the sections of the organization that are not directly involved in the business plan about what is going on; transparency is integral in fostering trust and ownership for the business plan.§1: Using a bottom-up approach in which all layers of the organization are involved in order to empower the employees.§1: Change language from board language (data, KPI) to vision, values, and leadership when speaking to the organization as a whole. This is crucial to inspiring them. 2: You need to balance clear responsibilities and KPI driven performance evaluation with the human side e.g., acknowledging and celebrating successes.§1: Have a skilled HR team with an HR manager that is tasked with ensuring that everyone in the organization will understand what they have to achieve.§1: Share ownership for key people in the company. Management had about 20 % shares. 2: Recruited a number of new talents in the beginning to secure the growth possibilities.§1: All-hands meetings to ensure that everyone is on the same page. 2: Dumbing down the strategic plan so that people understand and know what to work towards is important.§1: Involvement from all areas in the organization 2: Constant follow up 3: Openness§1: Recruiting the right people in the right roles; we had tremendously strong culture within the company of mission driven folks that really believed in what we were doing; making diagnostic equipment more prevalent to lower income areas.§1: People are the most important; you have to have contact with each employee and be involved all processes; I was participating all kinds of meetings e.g., R&D, production, and sales & marketing. I was not intruding but participating. 2: Seeing the whole picture, sometimes the CEO just focuses on some part of the organization. But the CEO should see everything including the people, operational issues within the company.§1: Bottom up-approach; instill a sense in people that they are involved in setting the goals 2: Setting stretch targets to that people feel proud if they reach them.§1: Involvement; let people know what you would like to achieve as a group and as an organization 2: Create a sense of urgency 3: Ensure that units are aware when they’re underperforming.§1: Make sure that you have the right people with the right mindset 2: Align their incentives with yours; make them real owners with huge upside incentives 3: Make sure that you trust them; don’t do their work for them, let them down their job. Only intervene when it is really needed. 4: Make your strategy transparent to everyone 5: Breakdown strategy into department goals and follow up on these department goals. That way you create clarity down to the individual level.
30. Please§30. Please provide 2 specific suggestions for how you and the top management team could have ensured an even stronger organizational ownership for the business plan initiatives?§1: A much larger focus on feedback from the organization, open door policy, was only about 20% of my time unfortunately, I was often too busy to have such sessions.§1: The challenge of a bottom-up approach is that it requires a fair amount of trust in the organization and it usually takes time for the results to be visible. However, it is worth it. Classic Mckinsey type strategy implementation projects are often top-down and done in 6-12 months, but once the consultants leave, usually nothing has really changed.§1: It was far too down early in my career. I need to spend more time to work with the management team in order to get their ownership and involvement.§1:  Stop assuming that everyone knows what you are talking about. That is possible in a 20-person company but not in a 100-person company. You need to have a clear and aligned strategy otherwise the organization will be lost.§No. It was at the right level.§1: My leadership team were very operational and that is something we take pride. Our people know that we should not sit in the clouds but need to work on an operational level.  But it has been a limitation on expanding the company’s vision as we become slightly too short-term focused. 2.I would have pushed myself and my leaders to hire clever, young people that could have accelerated our growth.§1: Would have been very helpful if we had simplified the business plan to 2,3 pages.§1: Larger share-options for the management team; Impilo came with a highly complex incentive scheme that the management team did not really understand. Impilo priced them extremely aggressively.§1: A bit more control regarding R&D 2: More formal relations with certain employees; keeping discipline; it got a bit too relaxed.§1: Clarity about targets and progress in relation to targets across organization. Management had a high ownership but lower-levels were not as strong.§I’m quite OKAY with how what we did.§Generally satisfied: Everyone worked hard to get there.
31. Imagine§31. Imagine you responded to the following question 12-18 months into your CEO assignment – How strong is the overall ownership for the business plan´s objectives and key initiatives among the top 10% of management – please score on a 10 grade scale where “3” is poor, “5” is ok and “7” is good?§8 (in the beginning it was 10, but then we had a replacement of one of the vice-presidents and that replacement meant ownership with the new guy was not as strong as with others and it took me some time to get that guy in line with the rest)§8§9-10.

Which 3 key factors or actions would have improved the score to a strong 8 or 9?§§§1: Monthly townhall meetings where I’m transparent about the numbers, what is working and not working, and what we are trying to accomplish. Shortcutting communication from the CEO is not a good idea. Hearing information straight from the CEO’s mouth is more inspirational and ensure that information does not get lost through the bureaucracy.§§1: Bonus schemes was an immensely helpful way to ensure commitment from them.§1: I have made an effort to explain why P&L and balance sheet are important, what drives success, and where we need to be careful. This would increase the organizations understanding of the strategic plan.§§1: Mission driven; family run atmosphere where everyone believed in what we were doing. Everyone felt like they were part of the Cavidi family and enjoyed what they were doing.§§1: Transparency; e.g., communication regarding main-targets and progress on these targets. 2: Involving a wider-group as this instills empowerment and acceptance.§§
35. After§35. After 12-18 months into your CEO assignment; to what degree did you have your “dream-team” - i.e. the right person in the right place regarding the 5% highest managerial positions?§(v) The right person in the right place for 50-60% (5/10)§(v) The right person in the right place for 50-60%§(iv) The right person in the right place for 60-70 %§(iii) The right person in the right place for 70-80 %§(ii) The right person in the right place for 80-90 % (80%)§(ii) The right person in the right place for 80-90 % (I like an evolutionary approach where you slowly change key-positions.)§(vi) The right person in the right place for <50 % for the 5% highest managerial positions§§(ii) The right person in the right place for 80-90 %§(v) The right person in the right place for 50-60%§(i) The right person in the right place for >90 % for the 5% highest managerial positions§(v) The right person in the right place for 50-60%  (50%)
36. How§36. How could you have acted to better or faster ensure the right person in the right place for the top 5% managerial positions – top 2 suggestions?§It is about balance; not hiring too fast or hiring too slowly. You need to ensure that you keep pace with the market as well as the company’s growth trajectory but not to change people to the point that it creates uncertainty in the organization.§§1: It is important to stay with your gut feeling and listen to it. My weak side is that I have a very cynical side but I also have a very human side and want to give people a chance. On the other hand this human side helps me get people motivated and embrace me whilst also being able to  take tough decisions.§At least in Finland it is not very easy to shuffle people around.§The CFO position was not filled as fast as I would like. It was difficult to find the right candidate for that position that was prepared to work in the middle of Finland. The CFO is one of the key people when working with PE.§1: The CFO function should have changed much faster.  But I knew the market would be watching very closely of how the new CEO and the current CFO worked together. Furthermore, since  all of the knowledge of the company would be out of the door with the old CFO and the old CEO gone, I decided to keep the CFO. However, his competence level ended up being too low which had adverse consequences in the long-term.§1: A little more aware of the fact that personnel will need to change as the company changes: and being more upfront with people about this fact.§1: Pulled the trigger earlier; we were too slow moving on.§1: Most important is transparency and open discussions with the key personnel 2: Be prepared to fire when necessary.§1: Recognized much faster that the team did not possess the capabilities for the task at hand; sometimes emotions make it difficult to make necessary changes. 2: Stronger push from PE to change people; it is incredibly helpful.§It was perfect!§I had to work with what I had. I could not change anything without risking the status quo.
37. How§37. How did you secure speed & pace in the development and execution of the business plan – please describe the 2 most important factors or actions?§1: By far most important factor was hard-work; a lot of hours especially when you are under-investing as we did. 2: Involvement of the entire organization on an ongoing basis; if you cannot do that forget about implementing anything.§1: Dedicated resources i.e.  having a head of BMO that is dedicated to make things progress. 2: Viewing internal communication as an investment rather than a cost, and giving it as a big of a budget as external marketing. Your internal customer for strategy implementation is your employee, and this requires giving them great attention. We used all means to achieve this e.g., daily newsletters, podcast, posters. Be creative.§1: Use time every year to decide what we need to do every year in terms of responsibility and expectations. 2: Build a strong follow up system. People know I will follow up on each strategic project and that they have to stand up during every meeting and give me an overview of their progress.§1: The key is having a great sales team.§1: We worked very closely with the PE members and the management team. We had once or twice per year common meetings so it was not only the CEO that raised the most important issues, timelines and strategies. That was a very good way to work.§1: Analyzing weekly and monthly performance to ensure a result-oriented approach in the company. I spend a lot of time myself looking at our numbers to understand where we are and where need to improve.§1: Constant follow in order to ensure that people are involved, they know what to do, and keep the focus on the right things. 2: Balance activities with resources in order to achieve the activities.§1: Right personnel that were driven by the company’s mission§1: Combination of R&D, production and marketing focus and achieving alignment between those structures; this is key for our industry.§1: Top-management has to be involved otherwise it can easily drop. 2: Need to allocate the right resources to do the job otherwise you will not get speed and quality. 3: PE owners were very patient and allowed us to iterate the business plan and improve it.§1:PE were not focused on the annual returns but they firmly believed in the business model and it’s long-run results. This allowed us to focus on longer term initiatives. 2: PE firm trusted us which allowed us to get necessary investments as well run-up costs when needed.§1: When we make a strategy we define MUST-win battles; we only focus on getting those down.
38. What§38. What could you have done even better to secure speed & pace in the development and execution of the business plan - top 2 suggestions?§1: This may sound ruthless but necessary for goal achievement; you have to be quicker in executing on under-performing individuals. If you have a bad sense of someone in the management team, then you need to act. Don’t wait. To be clear, I should have fired one or two people much more quickly than I did.§1: Spend even more time with middle management because where that is where the magic happens.§1: Put more shine on people during meetings to motivate them.§1: Simply starting everything earlier than we had although that is easy to say retroactively.§1: Important to monitor the external environment as it is constantly changing.§1: We were too reckless on some big strategic projects. We should have understood the risks better. For example, we executed on a project that we later found out was not legal in Norway.§1: Pick the right initiatives and quickly ditch the ones that are not working because you do not have time to fix them when you are a new company.§1: Impilo should have stepped in earlier and give us support in terms of capital.§1: A bit more investments in sales and marketing as well more cooperation between the two.§1: Pare down initiatives and allocate enough resources for each initiative. 2: Hire the right team much more quickly.§None (again!)§1: It is a matter of prioritization; tendency to do many things. However, if you do reduce them you need to make sure that they are the ones that drive most value.

Which 3 key factors or actions would have improved the score to a strong 8 or 9?§§§§§§See question 38.§§1: Transition to product-scale up could have been addressed with perhaps the right experts 2: Spent money on making things move instead of sticking rigidly to a budget; we focused on cutting costs when we should have been focusing on scaling up§§1: Reduced number of initiatives 2: Allocated more resources to each initiative§§
42. In§42. In which ways did you secure the organization’s success in implementing the mission-critical initiatives in the business plan– please describe the 2 most important factors or actions?§1: Frequent involvement and transparency; investment memorandum sent throughout organization, direct follow up during meetings, traveling to subsidiaries.§1: Rigorous and transparent follow up in all organizational layers. 2: Helping the entire organization understand why certain initiatives and indicators are important. For example, I thought that everyone in the company needs to understand return on capital employed (ROCE). Owners thought I was crazy for trying this, but I told them that they were underestimating the intelligence of the average human being.§1: An understanding in the management team of how important the must-win battles are for the organization and for PE. 2: Clear timeline on the must win battles, who is driving them, and what we gain for achieving them.§1: Clear accountability. This involves rewarding people when they achieve the desired targets and requiring them to present their progress during follow-up sessions.§1: We had one management team member responsible for each key initiative. They were charged with representing the current status, development and key challenges of the initiative. This created ownership.§1: It was quite easy since it is a very small organization. I knew everyone by name. We had all hands meetings and weekly follow up on each initiative.§Same as the prior question.§1: As a team spent a quite bit of time going through the busines strategy and going through the Mckinsey report to make sure that we had things in place to optimize our chances of success.§1: Focusing people; Motivating them, clear messages to people about what we are doing and where we are going.§1: Allocate enough resources 2: Eventually hiring the right people§Same as answer as 37 according to Tormod§1: Breaking down must-win battles to individual departments and people.
43. What§43. What could you have done differently to enable even stronger organizational success in implementing the business plan - top 2 suggestions?§1: Implement a number of information screens across the organization including in subsidiaries in foreign countries with constant updated KPI’s.§1: Fostering empowerment by pushing down decision making in the organization even for difficult strategic decisions. 2: Leading by example.§1: Part of it is a learning curve. I was new to the industry. But now that I have more knowledge, I know which are the must-win battles and I’m comfortable delegating.§Nothing new to add.§1: The management team could have been more diversified. It was very homogenous with people from PE and the management team being very similar. We needed different perspectives to adapt to the rapidly changing external environment.§1: Been bolder and more made some acquisitions, not for volume or growth, but for new competencies and technology.§1: You can always do more in informing and following up on people.§1: Hiring competent, industrial minded, commercial managers to take over the project team and transition us from a project led organization to a commercial scale-up.§1: More strong cooperation between R&D, marketing, and sales. 2: Rearranged the management team faster than we did.§1: From the very beginning to allocate the right people for each initiative.  2: Clear plan for the achievement of each initiative§1: Spent even more time in the regions/divisions where the potential was the highest i.e. giving better support and even tighter§1: Hired right people fast; easier said than done though.

Alimaka had at the time developed into a company that were not selling their products outside of the western world. It had a price level on their products that made them completely non-competitive in all emerging and growing markets. We had made ourselves not competitive. So crucial so in those ambitions was to develop products in China that were competitive in that part of the world which is both an offensive and defensive strategy. At some stage those Asian players will arrive in the western markets so it was also a preemptive measure.) 2: Restructuring (closing down of units that were bleeding for years) 3: Digitalization§1:  Organic growth 2: Innovation

49. If§49. If you could do your CEO journey all over again from day 1 – what would you have done slightly or entirely differently to ensure an even better success – 2 specific examples?§1: Ruthless in firing people that were underperforming 2: Larger resources dedicated to hiring the right people to keep up pace with growth§1: Having an initial conversation with the owners about their intentions and exit strategy for the company as this fosters alignment and trust. 2: Replaced some people earlier.§1: More tough on my decisions and taken them much fast4er. 9/10 my stomach feeling ends up being the right one. 2: Trying to get an even faster view of the industry prior to my start.§1: Get the sales team up and running earlier as they are crucial to our success. 2: Pressure the PE to improve the board composition; have more industry experts to support the CEO to build the strategy.§I believe I have already answer this question in the questionnaire.§1: I would spend more time with the board to ensure alignment. For a CEO, in a PE owned company, it is extremely vital to be aligned and close with the board. It is important because it is at the board level were you ultimately make the decisions. Although execution lies with the CEO, decisions are made at the board level.§1: I would have boiled down the strategy plan from 150 pages to 5 pages; only focus on the initiatives that will work 2: I would have used much more time in communicating the strategic plan and getting people to understand the plan.§I wish I had your book to read ;) People told me that it was too early to bring in an PE owner, but I brought them in because we needed the money. That was in retrospect a mistake since the match with the stage company was in. We were 24 months too early in reaching for PE company, and should have waited. I would say that a lot of the fundamental issues raised throughout this interview are not necessarily specific to Impilo but simply due to a mismatch between the stage the company was in and the expertise that Impilo had (as they were mostly focused on growth stage companies and mature companies). They are not cut-out for the entrepreneurial journey.§1) Organizing the management team in a better way 2: I should have been in more involved the coordination between sales and marketing and R&D.§1: Having the courage to make changes and take the hard-steps such as changing people and hiring new people. 2: Improving prioritization of the most initiatives; I would have put much more emphasis on this.§If you have some doubts about some people and they occupy key positions then it is typically sign to fire them. Go ahead and do it even if it is painful.§1: Important to spend quite some time as a team before setting numbers and ambition: Build that trust to start with it. Don’t just come in with the strategy and try to execute on it without making sure that you have a high performing team in place.
50. Lastly,§50. Lastly, our conversation has covered best practices and lessons learnt in order to succeed as a CEO in a private equity context – on that theme – which are your top 3 specific advice to an incoming CEO who is new to the private equity context?§1: Ensure that you are completely aligned with the PE firm regarding view of company fundamentals, required resources and targets 2: Don’t be afraid of stating your opinion and asking questions 3: Don’t be afraid of saying when you do not have the required competences to actually solve a given problem at any given time; you’re not superman, you should not be the best everything 4: Work to always make yourself superfluous/not necessary; that is a good way to make sure that you empower everybody else.§1: Understand the strategy, the profile, and the inner logic of the PE. What is their thing? What is it that really do? We often fall into the trap that every PE is the same animal which is not the case. 2: Ensure that you have a good chairman of the board in terms of chemistry, trust, and values. 3: Make sure that you are 100% of what your mandate and limits are, and within those limits whip the hell out of the business; You will be fired one day anyway so take your place and make sure that you maximize your business.§"If I had a coffee with an incoming CEO off-the record I would say the following: 
1: The board meetings can be very cold because they are very data driven. There is no bullshit. You need to leave your feelings outside and focus on their KPI’s. It does not mean that PE don’t like you but rather that their focus is on the commercial 100%. In private companies, there is often an interest in your personal life. But you have to get used to it being much colder under PE. 2: Be aware of how you bridge the board dialogue into motivating the organization and breaking down the strategic plan. KPI’s are important, but you need to build a vision and fun organization around it to motivate people. 3: Make 100% sure that you gather the right people around you."§1: Stay calm and believe in yourself; PE are not always right. They will challenge you and ask you to do things that you cannot achieve. Their job is to set very high targets; don’t get too frustrated about not achieving them. 2: Take time away from work to achieve clarity in your mind as this helps you to do your job even better.§1: Set annual milestones and targets to create a common path for the long-term strategy 2: At the out clarify expectations and your mandate with the PE firm. 3: Diversify management team to get different perspectives§1: Really understand and align what the expectations are and have a shared strategy. Agree what is important. 2: Managing expectations i.e., the timeline for achieving these goals. Sometimes you will have an unrealistic expectation of the time line. 3: Building trust and good relationships. I’m a very much a numbers person but I also understand that the relationship aspect is extremely important. Get to know and learn your board.§1: Don’t take the job haha! I do not think it is much difference between working in a family owned or a PE company. I have heard that PE owners are number strict and have a 100% number focus but I do not feel that at all. 2: Let the PE fund get involved in the business with their ideas and advices; do not overprotect yourself. A lot of PE funds have a lot of operational expertise. I tried to involve my chairman board as much as possible so they’re no surprises. 3: Do not defend yourself; be open to criticism. 4: Let them apply the competencies they have. The hardest part is actually prioritizing what competencies of theirs that we should use. 5: Get in front of the numbers; everything is easier when you are over-performing on the numbers that you have agreed to.§1: Alignment of the core-business objectives between the CEO and what the PE owners expect needs to be spot-on. Are they there for money? Are they there to support the core-business? What exactly do we need them for?2: During DD everyone wants everything to look beautifully so you got to disclose where you are.§1: You have to listen the PE owners even if they do not understand the business. 2: Nothing else; she feels that we are going in circles now!§1: Getting the overall targets made very clear between the CEO and the PE firm.  2: Build quickly relationship with PE owner in order to foster mutual trust. Mutual trust is like putting money in the bank; you can use it later on. 3:  Be very open towards the PE owners; it fosters trust and also shows PE owners where you need help which allows them to use their extensive  network to help the issue.§1: Spend time with the deal team on the PE side; make sure that you are absolutely aligned and make sure that you have the trust. This will serve the CEO well in the years to come.§1: Understand what creates shareholder value; it is not just EBITDA. It could be IP, stickiness, digitalization and so forth. The ideal situation is a razor-razor blade model with strong IP, strong digitalization, high scalability and low CAPEX as well potential for consolidation as well as using acquisitions. Most companies think of cost synergies when acquiring company but focus instead on aligning incentives through e.g., earnouts. Integration can come later. Then you have everything model. *Razor-razor blade: This is a business model where you have a base system and then have to buy consumables with/for system. Highly attractive because you lock in the customers. 2: Make sure that you understand your business and how you can identify the sweet spot of value creation. Make sure that you have a razor-sharp focus on the items that will drive EBITDA. 3: Make sure that you have a team around you that can execute on the business plan. 4: Make sure that you have a very strong ownership with your owner beyond just board meetings; don’t be afraid to say that you don’t know!
