Exercise 7 
----------

Can you help him?

Exercise 8
----------

Natural numbers may be defined as follows in Prolog:

natural_number(0).
natural_number(s(X)) :- natural_number(X).

The first fact asserts that "0" is a natural number while the second one says that if X is a natural number, then the s(X) is also a natural number.

a) Define an operation "plus(X,Y,Z)" where the first two arguments are two natural numbers to be added and the result is given in the third argument.
*/

b) Define an operation "mult(X,Y,Z)" which makes the product of the first two arguments giving the result in the third.
