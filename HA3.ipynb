    "# Task 3: Deep Double Q-learning (DDQN)\n",
    "For this task, you will implement a DDQN (double deep Q-learning network) to solve one of the problems of the OpenAI gym. Before we get into details about these type of networks, let's first review the simpler, DQN (deep Q-learning network) version. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Q Networks\n",
    "As we saw in the video lectures, using a neural network as a state action value approximator is a great idea. However, if one tries to use this approach with Q-learning, it's very likely that the optimization will be very unstable. To remediate this, two main ideas are used. First, we use experience replay, in order to decorrelate the experience samples we obtain when exploring the environment. Second, we use two networks instead of one, in order to fix the optimization targets. That is, for a given minibatch sampled from the replay buffer, we'll optimize the weights of only one of the networks (commonly denoted as the \"online\" network), using the gradients w.r.t a loss function. This loss function is computed as the mean squared error between the current action values, computed according to the **online** network, and the temporal difference (TD) targets, computed using the other, **fixed network** (which we'll refer to as the \"target\" network).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the loss function is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(Q(s_i,a_i; \\theta\\right) - Y_i)^2~,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of samples in your minibatch, $Q(s,a;\\theta)$ is the state action value estimate, according to the online network (with parameters $\\theta$), and $Y_t$ is the TD target, computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = r_i +  \\gamma ~\\underset{a}{\\text{max}}~Q(s_i', a; \\theta^-)~, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q(s', a;\\theta')$ is the action value estimate, according to the fixed network (with parameters $\\theta^-$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, so that the offline parameters are also updated, we periodically change the roles of the networks, fixing the online one, and training the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Double Deep Q Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea explained above works well in practice, but later it was discovered that this approach is very prone to overestimating the state action values. The main reason for this is that the max operator, used to select the greedy action when computing the TD target, uses the same values both to select and to evaluate an action (this tends to prefer overestimated actions). In order to prevent this, we can decouple the selection from the evaluation, which is the idea that created DDQN. More concretely, the TD target for a DDQN is now \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = r_i + \\gamma Q(s_i', \\underset{a}{\\text{argmax}}Q(s_i',a;\\theta); \\theta^-)~. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we're using the **online** network to select which action is best, but we use the **fixed** network to evaluate the state action value for that chosen action in the next state. This is what makes DDQN not overestimate (as much) the state action values, which in turn helps us to train faster and obtain better policies.\n",

Other than adding convolutional layers to your neural network, there is one more issue regarding the new input that needs to be solved. Name at least two solutions to the problem, and why it won't work without these changes. \n",

    "**Your answer:** In the case of pong, a single screenshot would not contain information about the direction and velocity of the ball, hence making it impossible to predict where the ball will go. The image does not contain temporal information. This can be solved by storing screenshots through time and feeding it as input to the network. Another solution is to include a recurrent layer that can store and use faetures from previous time steps. "
